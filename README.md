# Teemo Trade Progress
The objective of this project is determining if my usage of Teemo's (League of Legends) combos when fighting in-game has improved over the 12th season of the game. This can be determined by the total amount of damage Teemo deals in a continuous amount of time. The data used is obtained through the Riot API.
