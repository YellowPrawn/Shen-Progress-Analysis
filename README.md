# Shen-Progress-Analysis
The objective of this project is determining if I have improved in using Shen's (League of Legends) ultimate ability in the past 9 months. This can be determined by pulling my player match history from the Riot Development API and analyzing the timeline of each match where I played Shen. Then, I determine the effectiveness of my usage of Shen's ultimate ability by observing if an assist was obtained through it, the damage I dealt, and if a teammate was saved. 
After obtainining the data, I will then determine the trends in each of the factors mentioned in the above through basic time series analysis to see if my usage of the ability is consistent or if it varies within games.
The results of the analysis are purely for personal understanding to potentially improve my performance while playing Shen.
