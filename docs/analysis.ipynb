As a crucial part of Teemo's ability kit and identity, it is unsurprising that utilizing more shrooms in a game results in a higher kill participation. \n",

    "With this in mind, there are many areas which could be improved on for this project. A large drawback of the Riot API is that we can only obtain a player's previous 100 matches. Therefore, it is hard to confidently apply any statistical testing due to the small amounts of data. One possible work around to this is for me to play multiple consecutive games of Teemo to maximize the amount of data available. Alternatively, an automatic scraper could be used once every few months to record a match history greater than the limit provided in the Riot API. This could allow for even more data without the need for the previous solution."
